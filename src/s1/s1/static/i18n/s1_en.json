Often enough, a well-phrased heading points the readers in the right direction. Below it, in the text area, describe your idea more precisely so everybody gets the picture.\n\n**Discuss** your ideas and those of others. Don't hesitate to write down your own solutions or information that other solutions are missing. That way, the other participants may get updated. If you think an idea is especially relevant, indicate it by rating '+1'. Each idea's current rating is visible on next to the arrows. \n\n**Rate ideas**. You can rate ideas you deem relevant or irrelevant anytime. You may rate several ideas. The idea with the gihest rating wins.\n\nInformation in German on one workshop using this project can be found [on the LIQD site](http://downloads.liqd.net/EMU%20Stendal%20Schulung%20und%20Hintergrund%20160901.pdf).",
